## Lab 5

### Titanic Dataset

Data source : [Kagle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

1.  **lab5** - analysis of missing values
2.  **lab5_cardinity** - cardinality analysis of features

## Lab 6

The same data source. This time the goal was:

1. feature engineering
2. learning how to split data into train and test subsets

## Lab 7-8

This contains a machine learning pipeline developed using a dataset provided by dane.gov.pl. The dataset selected for this project is titled "zestawienie_dane_IzZ_2023.csv" that you can review or download from [this page](https://dane.gov.pl/pl/dataset/3573,zdarzenia-psp/resource/55861/table). The goal of this project is to perform initial data exploration, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare data for further machine learning tasks.
